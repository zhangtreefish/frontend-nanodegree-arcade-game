for self-checking their submission.

Welcome to my Frogger game!
You will move the girl player with the up, down, left, and right keys. Your goal is to reach the water without bumping into the enemy bugs, or venturing outside the playground. You may become twice as faster by collecting the positive energy in each gem.  The red darting dot is just to cheer you on, and will not jeopadize your mission upon encountering.
Enjoy, and write me feedbacks. Thank you!
