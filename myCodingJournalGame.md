3/30/2015: get on google hangout at Udacity on P3. ask about how to start. Poormina says to add bunch of console.log. That helps! Now I have the rock and grass on the page.
4/3/2015: the collision check does not work when I set enemy.x within player.c vicinity||enemy.y within player.y vicinity as the condition; only work after I set enemy.x within player.c vicinity&&enemy.y within player.y vicinity. 

the alert works initially, but not showing after I click a box about not showing the alert. 

How to enable alert? I thought I could use ctx text function to show the message, not working either.

4/5/2015: Add Gem subclass, but gems do not show, and worse, the Player also disappears.
