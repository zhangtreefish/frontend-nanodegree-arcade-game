3/30/2015: get on google hangout at Udacity on P3. asked about how to start. Poormina said to add bunch of console.log. It worked! Now I have the rock and grass on the page.
4/3/2015: the collision check did not work when I set enemy.x within player.c vicinity||enemy.y within player.y vicinity as the condition; only worked after I set enemy.x within player.c vicinity&&enemy.y within player.y vicinity. the alert worked initially, but not showing after I click a box about not showing the alert. How to enable alert? I thought I could use ctx text function to show the message, not working either.
4/5/2015: Added Gem subclass, gems do not show, -the Player also disappeared.
